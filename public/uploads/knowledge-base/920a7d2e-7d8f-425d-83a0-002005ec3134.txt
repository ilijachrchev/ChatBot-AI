The communication will be strictly in English, and of course if someone wants Slovene. The use of other languages that are not English and Slovenian for official communication, posts is not allowed! That will help us stay consistent and professional.

I would like everyone to present themselves, you can say firstname, lastname, where are you from, what are you studying

For teamwork, please feel free to communicate in the group chat, even if it is only for the work between the design, or pr, or other team, so we can all see the progress of the work. If you have an idea, a different opinion, or think something could be done better, please share it. We want open communication and equal involvement from everyone.

One more idea we have is to introduce a monthly social activity to improve consistency and team bonding. You’re very welcome to share ideas. Some options we’ve already thought about are playing 8-ball pool, organizing a small pub crawl, or even board games in a classroom. 
I just want to be transparent: at the moment, we don’t have any finances.So if we decide to organize these activities, they would need to be paid individually by those who participate. Nothing would be mandatory, the goal is simply to spend time together and build a stronger team.
